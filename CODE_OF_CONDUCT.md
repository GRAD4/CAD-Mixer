Please try your best to be enjoyable to work with, which means being:

- Friendly and patient.
- Welcoming to others and others point of view. This means that you will interact with respect towards people of different backgrounds. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- Considerate in your word and your work. Other people will be impacted by your work or the word that you choose. Be empathetic and think about the repercussions of your actions towards the GRAD4 community before acting.
- Be respectful.  We will not and shouldnâ€™t agree all the time. However, disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. If something is bothering you to the point of being frustrated, elevate the problem as soon as possible, either to the human relation representative, your manager, the leadership team or the executive team.
- When you disagree with someone, try to understand why. Move to the root cause of your disagreement and put it in writing. Document why you disagree and try to elevate the discussion if you are still experiencing a deadlock.
- Be careful in the words that you choose. Conduct yourself professionally. This means that you should refrain from:
  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  - Discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. 

Let's keep it fun and light!
